# ATask Project - Git Task Manager

**Project Status**: Active Development  
**Created**: 2025-08-25  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-25  
**Language**: Rust  
**Database**: LibSQL + GitHub API Integration  

## Project Overview

ATask is a Rust-based task management system that integrates with Git to automatically track commits and manage issues with custom labels. The project provides a foundation for building comprehensive task management workflows with Git integration.

## Development Preferences & Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Mandatory Approach**: Use strict Red-Green-Blue TDD methodology
- **Reference Documentation**: `~/.agents/development/tdd-development.md`
- **Process**:
  1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first (verified automatically)
  2. **Green Phase**: Minimal implementation to pass tests
  3. **Blue Phase**: Refactor while maintaining green state
- **Enforcement**: Use automated test failure validation during Red phase
- **No Exceptions**: All new functionality must follow TDD cycle

### Code Quality Standards
- **No Emojis/Unicode**: Keep code professional unless specifically requested
- **Logging**: Use `log` crate instead of `println!` or `eprintln!`
- **Diff Visibility**: Always show code diffs for transparency
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's safety features, minimize unsafe code

### Version Control Practices
- **Reference Documentation**: `~/.agents/development/version-control.md`
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each development step
- **Tools**: Use both `git` and `gh` (GitHub CLI) command line tools
- **Code Reviews**: Create code reviews on plan completion
- **Transparency**: Always allow viewing and editing of commits, PRs, and reviews

### Security Practices
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct security audits using available tools
- **Tools**: Use `cargo-audit`, `cargo-fuzz`, clippy for Rust-specific security
- **Reference Documentation**: 
  - `~/.agents/security/code-security-audit.md`
  - `~/.agents/security/sql-security-audit.md`
- **Dependency Security**: Monitor for vulnerable dependencies

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning**: Create step-by-step plans with clear checkboxes
2. **Implementation**: Follow TDD methodology strictly
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with automated validation
4. **Review**: Code reviews for quality and consistency
5. **Security**: Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
6. **Documentation**: Maintain clear, professional documentation

### Issue Update Guidelines
- **Concise Updates**: Keep issue comments brief and focused
- **Avoid Repetition**: Don't repeat information already in the issue description
- **Focus on NEW**: Only mention what's newly completed or changed
- **Link Commits**: Include relevant commit links for traceability
- **Next Steps**: Briefly state what's ready for next phase
- **Stats Summary**: Include key metrics (tests, lines, files) concisely
- **No Architecture Details**: Avoid repeating technical details already documented

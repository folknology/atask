# ATask Project - Git Task Manager

**Project Status**: Active Development  
**Created**: 2025-08-25  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-25  
**Language**: Rust  
**Database**: LibSQL + GitHub API Integration  

## Project Overview

ATask is a Rust-based task management system that integrates with Git to automatically track commits and manage issues with custom labels. The project provides a foundation for building comprehensive task management workflows with Git integration.

## Development Preferences & Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Mandatory Approach**: Use strict Red-Green-Blue TDD methodology
- **Reference Documentation**: `~/.agents/development/tdd-development.md`
- **Process**:
  1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first (verified automatically)
  2. **Green Phase**: Minimal implementation to pass tests
  3. **Blue Phase**: Refactor while maintaining green state
- **Enforcement**: Use automated test failure validation during Red phase
- **No Exceptions**: All new functionality must follow TDD cycle

### Code Quality Standards
- **No Emojis/Unicode**: Keep code professional unless specifically requested
- **Logging**: Use `log` crate instead of `println!` or `eprintln!`
- **Diff Visibility**: Always show code diffs for transparency
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's safety features, minimize unsafe code

### Version Control Practices
- **Reference Documentation**: `~/.agents/development/version-control.md`
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each development step
- **Tools**: Use both `git` and `gh` (GitHub CLI) command line tools
- **Code Reviews**: Create code reviews on plan completion
- **Transparency**: Always allow viewing and editing of commits, PRs, and reviews

### Security Practices
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct security audits using available tools
- **Tools**: Use `cargo-audit`, `cargo-fuzz`, clippy for Rust-specific security
- **Reference Documentation**: 
  - `~/.agents/security/code-security-audit.md`
  - `~/.agents/security/sql-security-audit.md`
- **Dependency Security**: Monitor for vulnerable dependencies

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning**: Create step-by-step plans with clear checkboxes
2. **Implementation**: Follow TDD methodology strictly
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with automated validation
4. **Review**: Code reviews for quality and consistency
5. **Security**: Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
6. **Documentation**: Maintain clear, professional documentation

- `Cargo.toml` - Project configuration with Git/GitHub API dependencies

### Database Schema
- **commits**: Git commit tracking with file changes and statistics
- **issues**: Task management with status, priority, and labels
- **labels**: Customizable categorization system
- **issue_labels**: Many-to-many relationship between issues and labels

### Key Features Implemented
- Git history integration with automatic commit import
- CRUD operations for commits, issues, and labels
- Default GitHub-style label system

## Development History

### Major Recent Accomplishments (2025-08-25)

#### âœ… Database Unit Testing Implementation (Issue #2)
- **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive unit test suite with 22 passing tests
- **Implementation**: Following strict TDD Red-Green-Blue methodology
- **Coverage**: All database CRUD operations, edge cases, and error handling
- **Features**: In-memory SQLite testing, helper functions, comprehensive assertions
- **Result**: 100% test pass rate, solid foundation for TDD development

#### âœ… Rust-based Git/GitHub Operations (Issue #3)
- **COMPLETED**: Full replacement of CLI tools with native Rust libraries
- **Problem Solved**: CLI tools opening editors/pagers causing interaction issues
- **Implementation**: 
  - `GitOps` struct using `git2` crate for repository operations
  - `GitHubOps` struct using `octocrab` crate for GitHub API
  - No external CLI dependencies (git, gh commands)
- **Features**:
  - Parse GitHub repository info from remote URLs
  - Get commits with file changes and statistics
  - Create issues, add comments, list issues/labels
  - Environment-based GitHub token authentication
- **Testing**: Working example demonstrating all functionality
- **Result**: Eliminated CLI interaction problems, better error handling
